## Welcome to the documentation of the Vinegar project!

Vinegar is an open-source, transparent, minimal, configurable, and fast bootstrapper for Roblox Player and Roblox Studio. It provides a streamlined experience for setting up and running Roblox on Linux systems.

### Before getting started
- The comprehensive documentation and source code for Vinegar are readily available on [GitHub](https://github.com/vinegarhq).
- Vinegar currently lacks a graphical configuration interface at this time.
- Vinegar serves as a viable alternative to [Grapejuice](https://brinkervii.gitlab.io/grapejuice/), another popular Roblox bootstrapper for Linux.

**To get started**, you can proceed to [the installation guide](/Installation/index.md)!

**The Discord server** for Vinegar can be found [here](https://discord.gg/dzdzZ6Pps2).
