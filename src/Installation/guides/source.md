# Installation from source

## Installing Wine
Before you can install Vinegar, you will first have to install Wine first. You can use the guide for your distribution on the [wine wiki](https://wiki.winehq.org/Download). For instance, you can find guides for [Arch](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/wine) and [Gentoo](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Wine). Additionally, you will need the GnuTLS library in-order for Roblox networking to function properly:

- Arch: `lib32-gnutls`
- Void: `gnutls-32bit` via `void-repo-multilib`
- Gentoo: `net-libs/gnutls` via `ABI_X86="64 32"`, refer to [Gentoo Wiki: package.use](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki//etc/portage/package.use)

It is recommended to ensure that you have installed Wine 8.3 or above on your system, as Roblox requires a minimum version of 8.0 and may encounter stability issues under 8.3. 

## Building Vinegar

To build Vinegar from source, you will need to install Go; it can be found packaged as `golang` or `go` on some Linux distributions.

## For Arch and derived:
```sh
sudo pacman -S go
```
## For Ubuntu and derived:
```sh
sudo apt install golang-go
```
## For Fedora and derived:
```sh
sudo dnf install golang
```

Clone Vinegar's git repository and build Vinegar:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/vinegarhq/vinegar
cd vinegar
make
```

## Installing Vinegar

To install Vinegar (in the source directory of vinegar):
```sh
sudo make PREFIX=/usr install
```
In this example we will use the /usr directory so of course we will need root permissions, so sudo is needed (you can change the directory if wanted, though this is the recommended directory for the installation). This will install Vinegar itself and it's icons for Roblox and Vinegar. It will also install the desktop files required for recognition by MIME.

Afterwards, you may set Vinegar as the default launcher or handler for Roblox Player and Studio respectively with the following command:
```sh
make mime
```

Alternatively, the following lines can be appended to `mimeapps.list` for users without [`xdg-mime`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/xdg-mime) on their system, which is used by the Makefile `mime` target:
