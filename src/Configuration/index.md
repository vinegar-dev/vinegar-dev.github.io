# Configuration

To adjust Vinegar or Roblox's behavior, the configuration may be edited. This is done through a configuration file. To edit this file, you may follow the steps below.

> **Note:** You only need to edit the configuration file if you want to fine tune Roblox's behavior. Having a configuration file is completely optional!

## Editing the configuration

Anything added to the configuration file is an override over the default configuration.

The configuration file (`config.toml`) may be easily edited by running the `vinegar edit` command. By using the `edit` command, error validation is also included.

If using Flatpak, the command is `flatpak run io.github.vinegarhq.Vinegar edit`.

If getting an error about an `EDITOR` variable, this can be temporarily fixed by running the command as `export EDITOR=nano; vinegar edit` (which will cause the `nano` editor to be used). Though, it is preferrable to set an `EDITOR` variable permanently, in a place like `.bashrc`.

## Configuration Values

| Name                 | Description                                                                                                | Default   |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| `wineroot`           | the path to a valid Wine 'root' installation directory.                                                    | none      |
| `dxvk_version`       | the DXVK version to be used; this can be set to legacy DXVK for old GPUs that don't support modern Vulkan. | `"2.3"`   |
| `multiple_instances` | allow for multiple instances of Roblox to be running simultaneously; see notes about ESYNC                 | `false`   |
| `sanitize_env`       | sanitize the global environment, hand-picked variables are allowed through.                                | `false`   |

If you're using the Flatpak, ensure that the path of the `wineroot` configuration option is allowed access from the Flatpak, as if it is a path outside of `~/.var/app/io.github.vinegarhq.Vinegar` Vinegar won't be able to access the directory: `flatpak override --user --filesystem=/path/to/wineroot`

| Section    | Description                                                                                                               |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[global]` | The global binary configuration for both Player and Studio, either can override, but FFlags and Environment are appended. |
| `[player]` | Binary configuration for Player                                                                                           |
| `[studio]` | Binary configuration for Studio                                                                                           |
| `[env]`    | Global environment, this is similar to `[global.env]`.                                                                    |
| `[splash]` | Configuraton for the loading screen of Vinegar                                                                            |

### Splash Configuration

| Option       | Description                                   | Default    |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ---------- |

| `Accent`     | color of the 'Show Log' and progress bar      | `0x8fbc5e` |

The colors are in hexadecimal format, stored as numbers internally such as `0xff00ff`.

### Binary Configuration

This section are the available options for the global, Studio or Player configurations, they are specified under their sections as listed above.

| Option             | Description                                                                                      | Default        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| `channel`          | the Roblox release channel                                                                       | `"live"`       |
| `launcher`         | the program that is used to launch Wine when launching Roblox; this can be set to `gamemoderun`. | none           |
| `renderer`         | selects the rendering engine to be used by Roblox via FFlags.                                    | `"D3D11"`      |
| `discord_rpc`      | use Discord's rich presence alongside handling the BloxstrapRPC protocol.                        | Player: `true` |
| `forced_version`   | forces Vinegar to use a specific version, the release channel must be adjusted for the version.  | none           |
| `auto_kill_prefix` | automatically kill the wineprefix after the process exits                      .                 | `true`         |
| `dxvk`             | automatically uses DXVK for the application and installs if necessary.                           | `true`         |
| `gpu`              | specifies what gpu to use.                                                                       |`prime-discrete`|

`prime-discrete` does nothing on non-prime systems.

The options for `gpu` are the following:

`prime-discrete` makes Vinegar use a prime enabled gpu (Nvidia);                                                                                                                                                                                       
`integrated` makes Vinegar use integrated graphics (If present);                                                                                                                                                                                       
`0` to `9` makes Vinegar use a specific gpu based on their number;                                                                                                                                                                                     

Rich presence for Studio may not function correctly, as the BloxstrapRPC protocol had only been implemented for Player; keep in mind that Discord RPC includes telemetry by default.

The renderer must be one of the following: `"OpenGL"`, `"D3D11FL10"`, `"D3D11"`, `"Vulkan"`;
when using DXVK, ensure that the renderer is `"D3D11"`, otherwise Roblox will not utilize DXVK.

Sub-sections for FFlags and environment variables are specified with the section (eg. `[player.env]`)

| Sub-section | Default                                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `[fflags]`  | Player: `DFIntTaskSchedulerTargetFps = 640` |
| `[env]`     | none                                        |
