# Configuration

To adjust Vinegar or Roblox's behavior, the configuration may be edited. This is done through a configuration file. To edit this file, you may follow the steps below.

> **Note:** You only need to edit the configuration file if you want to fine tune Roblox's behavior. Having a configuration file is completely optional!

## Editing the configuration

Anything added to the configuration file is an override over the default configuration.

### Using `vinegar edit` (recommended)

The configuration file may be easily edited by running the `vinegar edit` command. By using the `edit` command, error validation is also included.

If using Flatpak, the command is `flatpak run io.github.vinegarhq.Vinegar edit`.

If getting an error about an `EDITOR` variable, this can be temporarily fixed by running the command as `export EDITOR=nano; vinegar edit` (which will cause the `nano` editor to be used). Though, it is preferrable to set an `EDITOR` variable permanently, in a place like `.bashrc`.

### Manually

The configuration file, `config.toml`, is read from `~/.config/vinegar/config.toml` (or `~/.var/app/io.github.vinegarhq.Vinegar/config/vinegar/config.toml` if using the Flatpak). It may be edited using any text editor (such as `nano`). First ensure the `config/vinegar` directory is created.

## Configuration Values

| Option               | Description                                                                                                | Default   |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |

For Studio or Player configurations, they are specified under the `[player]` or `[studio]` section.

| Option             | Description                                                                                     | Default                         |

| `renderer`         | selects the rendering engine to be used by Roblox via FFlags. See Notes for accepted renders.   | `"D3D11"`                       |
| `forced_version`   | forces Vinegar to use a specific version, the release channel must be adjusted for the version. | none                            |
| `auto_kill_prefix` | tells Vinegar to automatically kill the wineprefix after the application closes.                | Player: `true`, Studio: `false` |
| `dxvk`             | automatically uses DXVK for the application and installs if necessary.                          | Player: `true`, Studio: `false` |

Sub-sections for FFlags and environment variables for Player or Studio are specified as `[player.env]`/`[studio.env]` or `[player.fflags]`/`[studio.fflags]`

| Sub-section | Description                                                                       | Default                                     |

| `[fflags]`  | the sub-section used to set FFlags for the given application type.                | Player: `DFIntTaskSchedulerTargetFps = 640` |
| `[env]`     | the sub-section used to set environment variables for the given application type. | Player: `DXVK_HUD = "fps"`                  |

### Notes
* If you're using Nvidia PRIME, the drivers (on X server 1.20.7 and newer) and/or dxvk should automatically use your dGPU by default.
* The renderer must be one of the following: `"OpenGL"`, `"D3D11FL10"`, `"D3D11"`, `"Vulkan"`.
* Ensure that when setting a string, the value must be in quotes: `channel = "zintegration"`
* When using DXVK, ensure that the renderer is `"D3D11"`, otherwise Roblox will not utilize DXVK.
* If you're using the Flatpak, ensure that the path of the `wineroot` configuration option is allowed access from the Flatpak, as if it is a path outside of `~/.var/app/io.github.vinegarhq.Vinegar` Vinegar won't be able to access the directory: `flatpak override --user --filesystem=/path/to/wineroot`
* If you're using the Vinegar Flatpak and wish to use gamescope through the "launcher" setting, you MUST use their Flatpak versions, "com.valvesoftware.Steam.Utility.gamescope". Using gamescope from your distro will not work.
* When using MangoHud and using the Flatpak (`MANGOHUD` set to `"1"`), please make sure to run `flatpak override --user --filesystem=xdg-config/MangoHud:ro`, to allow the Vinegar Flatpak to access the MangoHud configuration in your home.
* The launcher option is not global, if it's under [player] it will only affect roblox, if it's under [studio] it will only affect studio.
