# Configuration

To change Vinegar's behavior, you may edit the `config.toml` file at `~/.config/vinegar/config.toml` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vinegar/config.toml` if applicable).

Anything added to the configuration file is an override over the default values, which are designed to be the best for the average user. However, by editing the configuration file you can tune your performance or apply other customizations.

Example configuration:

```toml
applyrco = true
autorfpsu = false
autokillpfx = true
dxvk = true
gamemode = false
log = true

version = "win10"
renderer = "D3D11"

[fflags]
FFlagFoo = "bar"
FFlagBar = true
FFlagBaz = 123

[env]
variablefoo = "bar"
```

The configuration above, except `fflags` and `env`, is the default configuration of Vinegar.
**Note:** it is important to ensure double quotes wherever needed - this shows we are working with text (strings).

If you wish to edit Vinegar's configuration, it is **highly** reccomended to use `vinegar edit`, as it will prevent configuration failures.

## Configuration fields

This section will explain what each field in the configuration file represents.

- `applyrco`: applies [RCO](https://github.com/L8X/Roblox-Client-Optimizer)'s FFlags to the Roblox Player automatically. If the user specifies FFlags it will simply be appended. RCO is a set of Roblox FFlags made to optimize Roblox Player's performance, for more information see the [README](https://github.com/L8X/Roblox-Client-Optimizer/blob/main/README.md) about it.

- `autorfpsu`: launches [rbxfpsunlocker](https://github.com/axstin/rbxfpsunlocker) automatically after the Roblox Player has launched. Please note that any configuration done to rbxfpsunlocker via the system tray will not be applied, as Vinegar sets its own rbxfpsunlocker configuration for a much faster startup.

- `autokillpfx`: automatically kills the Wineprefix after Vinegar detects that Roblox is no longer running, Please note that sometimes Roblox will hang and the process will still exist, which it is reccomended to run `vinegar kill`.

- `dxvk`: automatically installs DXVK onto the wineprefix upon Roblox launch, when set to false it will automatically uninstall as well. (NOTE: switching dxvk on and off on the flatpak does not do anything.)

- `gamemode`: automatically launches Roblox with [`gamemoderun`](https://github.com/FeralInteractive/gamemode).

- `log`: enables logging for Vinegar itself, found in `~/.cache/vinegar/vinegar-*.log`.

- `version`: is the value of the Wineprefix version, it has been set to `win10` for some performance increase, if you wish to change you should look for the valid versions via `vinegar exec winecfg /?`.

- `renderer`: selects the rendering engine to be used by Roblox. The final performance will vary from system to system. Possible values are:
    - `"OpenGL"`
    - `"D3D11FL10"`
    - `"D3D11"`
    - `"Vulkan"`

- `[fflags]`: used to set [Fast Flags](https://fflag.eryn.io/about) before launching Roblox. They can be set to `true`/`false`, numbers, or strings, depending on each one.

- `[env]`: used to set environment variables. These can only be strings.
